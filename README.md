# Bacteria-Study
If done correctly, the purpose of this project is to create a dashboard that will allow users to explore the data from the Belly Button Biodiversity study. The dashboard would allow users to select a test subject ID number and then display their information. This would be done using JavaScript, Plotly, D3, and Bootstrap.
